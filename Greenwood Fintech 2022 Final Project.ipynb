This means you believe the stocks will continue to perform well based on historical data and trends. You can learn more about this strategy <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum_investing.asp\">here</a>. <br> To compare this strategy you will test it against another strategy: buying the worst perfoming stocks.
